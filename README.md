# ALX-Data-Science-Program: A collection of projects from my ALX Data Science Program.
 
Welcome to my ALX Data Science Progress repo! This repository contains my work on various projects done in the program. Each folder represents a sprint and projects where I gain new knowledge in each sprint and apply it on guided projects. This collection is a testament to my continuous learning and passion for data science.

## Sprints
Here is a list of all the sprints in this repository:

1. **[Explore101: Introduction to Data Science and Problem-Solving](link-to-project)**
   - This sprint offers a foundational journey into data science, exploring big data, data-driven analysis, effective teamwork methodologies, and essential problem-solving techniques using tools like flowcharts, pseudocode, and design thinking.

2. **[Preparing Data: Essential Data Manipulation and Analysis](link-to-Project)**
   - This sprint focuses on mastering data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis in Google Sheets. It covers sourcing data, applying descriptive statistics, visualizing data, and ensuring data integrity. The sprint also includes practical projects on real-world issues like access to drinking water and introduces key concepts like hypothesis testing and model accuracy.

3. **[SQL: Mastering Database Management and Advanced Querying](link-to-Project)**
   - This sprint focuses on SQL essentials, from basic queries and database concepts to advanced topics like window functions, joins, and query optimization. It includes hands-on projects tackling real-world challenges, such as water crises, and concludes with a comprehensive SQL exam on The Movie Database.

4. **[Data Visualisation and Storytelling: Crafting Impactful Insights with Power BI](link-to-Project)**
   - This sprint focuses on mastering data storytelling and visualisation using Microsoft Power BI. You'll learn to create and format compelling visuals, build interactive dashboards, and employ DAX for advanced data manipulation. The integrated projects will challenge you to apply these skills to real-world scenarios, culminating in the creation of transparent, insightful public dashboards.

5. **[Python: Developing Comprehensive Data Solutions](link-to-Project)**
   - This sprint provides a deep dive into Python programming, starting from fundamental concepts like syntax, variables, and data structures, to advanced topics such as functions, recursion, object-oriented programming, and package creation. You'll learn to handle and analyse data using powerful libraries like NumPy and Pandas, perform data visualisation, and apply statistical methods. The sprint also covers version control with GitHub, scripting, testing, and best coding practices following PEP 8 standards. Integrated projects will challenge you to apply these skills to real-world scenarios, including building data pipelines and validating datasets, preparing you for robust and scalable data science applications.

6. **[Regression: Mastering Predictive Modelling Techniques](link-to-Project)**
   - This sprint focuses on essential regression techniques for predictive modelling, starting with fundamental linear regression and progressing through multiple linear regression, model evaluation, and advanced methods such as regularisation, decision trees, and ensemble methods. Youâ€™ll learn to implement and assess models, select relevant variables, and apply strategies like bootstrapping and random forests to enhance prediction accuracy. Practical code challenges and an MCQ will consolidate your skills in building and refining regression models.
